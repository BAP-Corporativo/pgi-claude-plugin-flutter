name: figma-hu-to-flutter
description: Implement a flow or screen in a Nextline PGI Flutter project (UNITED, FinsofApp and their versions) from the design team's handoff — the HU / user-story document ("HU - <flujo> - Handoff", Google Doc or .md), its row in the flows index spreadsheet (.xlsx), and the Figma nodes it links — reusing the project's existing widgets and creating new ones only when needed. Use this whenever the user shares a Figma link, an HU / historia de usuario / handoff document, or a flow name from the index and asks to implement, build, maquetar, construir, integrar or "pasar a código" a flow, pantalla, estado or componente — even if they only paste a figma.com/design link and say "constrúyelo" or say "implementa el flujo del simulador". This skill wraps Figma's figma-design-to-code guidance with the project's conventions.

# Figma + HU → Flutter

The design team delivers each flow as three linked artifacts. This skill turns them into code that follows the project's architecture and reuses its widgets.

| Artifact | What it gives you | What it never gives you |
|---|---|---|
| Flows index (`.xlsx`) | Flow name, description, link to its HU | Implementation details |
| HU handoff doc | Business rules, validations, states, navigation, Figma links per state, semantic tokens | Endpoints, data contracts, values the designers didn't fix |
| Figma nodes | Layout, components, variables, copy, assets | Behavior and business logic |

**The HU is the source of truth for behavior; Figma is the source of truth for visuals.** When they disagree (copy, amounts in mocks), the HU wins and the difference goes in the report.

## Step 0 — Resolve the project

Read `CLAUDE.md`. You need: `package`, the colors class (`UnitedColors` in UNITED), the scaffold widget, the widget catalog path, and where the HU index lives. Anything missing → ask once, then continue.

## Step 1 — Locate the HU

The flows index lives in Google Drive (`HU index` in `CLAUDE.md`; for UNITED: *Integración de Producto - PGI - UNITED.xlsx*). Columns:

| ID | Sprint | Plataforma | Módulo / Épica | Nombre de Feature | Descripción | Documentación |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| HU-6 | | App | Mi cuenta | Cambio de idioma en la app | … | HU - Cambio de idioma - Handoff.md |

- **User gave a flow name or HU id** → read the index with the Google Drive connector, match `ID` or `Nombre de Feature`, and confirm `Plataforma` contains `App` (rows marked only `Backoffice` are not implemented in the mobile app; `App + Backoffice` → implement only the app part). Then search Drive for the file named in `Documentación` and read it.
- **User gave an HU link or file** → read it directly.
- **User gave only a Figma link** → implement that node, but ask whether an HU exists before inventing behavior.
- **No Google Drive connector in this session** (`/mcp` doesn't list it) → ask the user to paste the HU or export it to the repo; don't guess from the Figma file alone.

## Step 2 — Build the implementation brief

The HU follows a fixed 5-section template. Translate each section with `references/hu-template-mapping.md` into a brief and **show it to the user before writing code**:

```markdown
## Brief: Simulador de inversión
Feature folder: lib/screens/investment_simulator/
Provider: InvestmentSimulatorProvider (state: currency, levels, amount, level, simulation)
Entry points: piggy-bank bottom sheet option "Simular inversión"; in-app notification
   Visibility rule: only if wallet balance > 0 in some currency → check at the entry point
Exit: "Invertir $[monto]" → new-investment flow with amount + currency preloaded
Validations (live): min 20,000 MXN / 1,200 USD / 1,200 EUR → "Debes invertir al menos [min] [divisa]";
   non-numeric → "Solo se aceptan números"; currency change → amount reset to 0.00
States of the result block: empty · loading (4-bar skeleton, delayed) · result · error + "Reintentar" (unlimited)
Performance: level + progress bar recalculated locally (optimistic); only the yield waits for the server
Figma nodes: 10 (selector, 3 result levels, 3 amount-field states, loading, error, button)

Endpoints: GET client/investment/simulator/levels?currency_id= · GET client/investment/simulator?currency_id=&amount=

## Gaps — need an answer before coding
1. `currency_id` for USD and EUR (only MXN = 3 is known) — or an existing currency source in the project.
2. Copy for levels with a forced term ("sin plazo forzoso" only covers term 0); `withdrawal_info` comes
   unlocalized ("360 dias") and the app is bilingual.
3. Does the new-investment flow already accept amount + currency as parameters?
4. `State Layers/Primary/Opacity-16` (#8d4e2a @16%) has no UnitedColors token.
```

Gaps are questions, not guesses. Ask them all in one message. If the user wants to start anyway, implement with a clearly named placeholder (e.g. a repository method with a `// TODO(HU gap 1)` comment) and list it again in the final report.

## Step 2b — Data contract

Follow `references/data-contract.md`: **models from the HU + Figma, DTOs from the endpoint JSON, mappers in between.**

- Endpoint JSON available (pasted by the user, or in the HU) → write DTOs from it.
- Endpoint not ready → ask for the agreed mock JSON, build the DTO from it and serve it with the mock interceptor (`flutter-api-endpoint`, "Mock-first"). Never invent a contract silently.
- Build the "screen value → source" table and add values with no source to the gaps.
- When an endpoint provides values the HU also lists (minimums, thresholds), use the endpoint and report any mismatch.

## Step 3 — Read Figma (cheapest calls first)

1. **Load Figma's guidance first** (the MCP requires it before `get_design_context`): use the `figma-design-to-code` skill if installed, otherwise `get_figma_skill` with `skill://figma/figma-design-to-code/SKILL.md`. Pass `skillNames` as that guidance says.
2. `get_variable_defs` on one full screen → the token set for the whole flow (cheap, no code).
3. `get_design_context` on **one full screen per distinct layout** (e.g. the Control 16 result screen), with `clientFrameworks: flutter`, `clientLanguages: dart`.
4. For the other states listed in the HU, request only the **changed component node** (amount field "bajo el mínimo", result block "error"), not the whole screen again. Process one screen at a time to protect context.
5. `get_screenshot` when you need the visual target for a node you didn't fetch with a screenshot.

The returned code is React + Tailwind. It is a **visual reference**, never code to translate line by line.

## Step 4 — Translate Figma to Flutter

Apply `references/figma-flutter-mapping.md`. The rules that matter most:

- **Ignore presentation chrome:** `.Building Blocks/status-bar`, `Camera Cutout`, the root frame's `Mockup` shadow and corner radius, absolute positions of the frame on the canvas.
- **Colors by token name, not hex:** `Schemes/<Name>` → `<ColorsClass>.<camelCaseName>` (`Schemes/On Surface Variant` → `UnitedColors.onSurfaceVariant`). Use the hex only to confirm. No token in the palette → it is a gap (Step 2), never a raw hex.
- **Typography by role:** `PGI United/<role>/<size>` → `Theme.of(context).textTheme.<role><Size>` when the project's text theme defines it; otherwise the project's text-style helper. A role that exists in neither (e.g. `headline/super small`) → report it.
- **Material 3 components → Material/project widgets**, not SVG pieces. Figma renders some M3 components (progress indicators, dividers, icons) as downloaded SVG segments; build them with Flutter widgets.
- **Assets:** download only real illustrations/images the project doesn't have. Icons → `Icons.*` or the project's existing icon assets.
- **Component descriptions are requirements:** "Selector ultra simple de divisa para el Simulador… MXN por defecto" tells you scope (feature-local) and behavior (default value).

> This deliberately overrides Figma's generic instruction to place every visible SVG asset: in a Flutter app, an M3 component drawn as SVG fragments is replaced by the native widget.

## Step 5 — Reuse ladder for every component

Open the widget catalog (`docs/widget-catalog.md`, or the path in `CLAUDE.md`). If it doesn't exist, build it first from `lib/widgets/widgets.dart` exports (see `references/widget-catalog-format.md`) and commit it with the feature.

For each Figma component, in this order:

1. **Exact match in the catalog** (or a Code Connect mapping returned by `get_design_context`) → use it.
2. **Close match** → extend it with an **optional** parameter that keeps every existing call site unchanged.
3. **Nothing similar** → create it:
   - used by this flow only, or the Figma description scopes it to this flow → `lib/screens/<feature>/widgets/`
   - reusable across flows → `lib/widgets/<group>/`, export it from `widgets.dart`, add it to the catalog.

Record every decision for the report.

## Step 6 — Implement

- Structure, provider, navigation → `flutter-feature-scaffold`.
- Endpoints (once the gap is answered) → `flutter-api-endpoint`.
- Every HU message and Figma copy → `flutter-intl-strings`. HU messages are the exact copy; Figma mock values (`$100,000.00`) are not strings, they're data.

### HU performance rules → provider code

"Optimistic UI" + "show loading only if it isn't instant" + "unlimited retry" translate to: local recalculation on every keystroke, debounced server call, delayed loading flag, and discarding stale responses.

```dart
class InvestmentSimulatorProvider extends ChangeNotifier {
  InvestmentSimulatorProvider({this.initialCurrency = SimulatorCurrency.mxn});

  final SimulatorCurrency initialCurrency;

  final secureRepository = ServiceLocator.getIt<SecureRepositoryImpl>();
  final investmentSimulatorRepository = ServiceLocator.getIt<InvestmentSimulatorRepository>();

  Future<String> _token() async => await secureRepository.token ?? '';

  static const _debounce = Duration(milliseconds: 300);
  static const _loadingDelay = Duration(milliseconds: 250);

  Timer? _debounceTimer;
  Timer? _loadingTimer;
  int _requestId = 0;

  Future<void> init() async {
    _currency = initialCurrency;
    await getLevels();
  }

  // --- Currency ---
  late SimulatorCurrency _currency;
  SimulatorCurrency get currency => _currency;

  Future<void> selectCurrency(SimulatorCurrency currency) async {
    if (_currency == currency) return;
    _currency = currency;
    _resetAmount();                        // HU: currency change resets the amount
    notifyListeners();
    await getLevels();
  }

  // --- Levels (server, loaded once per currency) ---
  bool _isLoadingLevels = false;
  bool get isLoadingLevels => _isLoadingLevels;

  InvestmentLevelsModel? _levels;
  List<InvestmentLevelModel> get levels => _levels?.levels ?? [];

  String? levelsError;

  Future<void> getLevels() async {
    _isLoadingLevels = true;
    notifyListeners();
    try {
      final token = await _token();
      _levels = await investmentSimulatorRepository.getLevels(token, _currency.id);
      levelsError = null;
    } catch (e) {
      _levels = null;
      levelsError = e.toString();
    } finally {
      _isLoadingLevels = false;
      notifyListeners();
    }
  }

  // --- Amount (optimistic, local) ---
  final amountController = TextEditingController();
  double _amount = 0;
  bool _isInvalidInput = false;

  InvestmentLevelModel? get level => _levels?.levelFor(_amount);

  String? get amountError {
    if (_isInvalidInput) return S.current.simulator_numbers_only;
    final minimum = _levels?.minimumAmount ?? 0;
    if (_amount == 0 || minimum == 0) return null;
    return _amount < minimum
        ? S.current.simulator_min_amount(formatAmount(minimum), _currency.code)
        : null;
  }

  void onAmountChanged(String raw) {
    final parsed = formatRawAmount(raw);   // existing helper
    _isInvalidInput = raw.trim().isNotEmpty && parsed == null;
    _amount = parsed ?? 0;
    notifyListeners();                     // level + progress bar update instantly
    _debounceTimer?.cancel();
    if (level == null || amountError != null) {
      _cancelPending();
      _simulation = null;
      return;
    }
    _debounceTimer = Timer(_debounce, getSimulation);
  }

  // --- Simulation (server, debounced) ---
  bool _isCalculating = false;
  bool get isCalculating => _isCalculating;

  SimulationModel? _simulation;
  SimulationModel? get simulation => _simulation;

  String? simulationError;

  bool get validateInvest => level != null && amountError == null && _simulation != null;

  Future<void> getSimulation() async {
    final id = ++_requestId;
    _loadingTimer?.cancel();
    _loadingTimer = Timer(_loadingDelay, () {
      if (id != _requestId) return;
      _isCalculating = true;               // skeleton only if it isn't instant
      notifyListeners();
    });
    try {
      final token = await _token();
      final result = await investmentSimulatorRepository.getSimulation(token, _currency.id, _amount);
      if (id != _requestId) return;        // a newer keystroke won
      _simulation = result;
      simulationError = null;
    } catch (e) {
      if (id != _requestId) return;
      _simulation = null;
      simulationError = e.toString();
    } finally {
      if (id == _requestId) {
        _loadingTimer?.cancel();
        _isCalculating = false;
        notifyListeners();
      }
    }
  }

  void _resetAmount() {
    _cancelPending();
    _amount = 0;
    _isInvalidInput = false;
    amountController.clear();
    _simulation = null;
    simulationError = null;
  }

  void _cancelPending() {
    _requestId++;
    _debounceTimer?.cancel();
    _loadingTimer?.cancel();
    _isCalculating = false;
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _cancelPending();
    amountController.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }
}
```

`SimulatorCurrency` is a small enum with `code` and `id` (`mxn('MXN', 3)`, …) until gap 1 is answered.

The "Reintentar" button calls `provider.getSimulation()` directly. The level is computed locally from the levels endpoint, so the progress bar never waits for the network.

### HU states → page sections

Only the result block reacts to loading/error; the selector, amount field and tabs stay interactive (HU section 3). Build it as one switch:

```dart
Widget _buildResultBlock(BuildContext context, InvestmentSimulatorProvider provider) {
  if (provider.isCalculating) return const SimulatorResultSkeleton();          // 4 bars
  if (provider.simulationError != null) {
    return SimulatorResultError(onRetry: provider.getSimulation);
  }
  final simulation = provider.simulation;
  if (simulation == null) return Text(S.of(context).simulator_empty_hint); // empty state
  return SimulatorResultCard(simulation: simulation);  // nextLevel == null → no suggestion
}
```

## Step 7 — Report (traceability)

End with:

1. **HU coverage:** each rule/state/navigation line of the HU → where it's implemented (file + method), or `PENDING (gap n)`.
2. **Figma mapping:** each Figma node → widget used, and whether it was **reused / extended / created** (with path).
3. **Tokens:** any token without a palette match, any typography role without a text style.
4. **Differences:** places where Figma mock data or copy contradicted the HU and what you followed.
5. Updated widget catalog entries.

## Anti-patterns

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Start coding from the Figma link while an HU exists | Read the HU, build the brief, confirm | Figma has no validations, states or navigation rules |
| Fill HU gaps with values from mocks ("$150,001 más" → threshold) | List them as gaps and ask | Mock data is illustrative; in a fintech app a wrong threshold is a business error |
| Translate the React/Tailwind output line by line | Use it as a visual reference; build with project widgets | It has absolute positioning, web semantics and fixed pixel widths |
| `Color(0xFF9E8B81)` | `UnitedColors.onSurfaceVariant` | Colors come from the palette by token name |
| `TextStyle(fontFamily: 'Montserrat', fontSize: 16, ...)` | `textTheme.titleMedium` (or the project's style helper) | Typography tokens map to theme roles |
| Implementing the status bar, camera cutout or Mockup shadow | Skip them | They are device/presentation chrome, not UI |
| Downloading the SVG segments of a progress indicator | Native progress widget styled with tokens | M3 components drawn as SVG fragments aren't assets |
| New widget without checking the catalog | Reuse ladder: exact → extend → create | Duplicate widgets drift apart |
| Changing an existing widget's required params to fit the design | Add an optional parameter with the old behavior as default | Every current call site must keep working |
| Loading spinner/skeleton on every keystroke | Debounce + delayed loading flag + discard stale responses | The HU forbids flicker and requires optimistic UI |
| Blocking the whole page on calculation error | Replace only the result block, keep inputs interactive | HU section 3 |
| `get_design_context` on every state's full screen | Full screen once per layout, then only the changed nodes | Each call costs a lot of context |

## Finish

1. `flutter analyze` passes; run `intl_utils:generate` and build_runner if strings/DTOs changed.
2. Start the report with `Skill aplicada: figma-hu-to-flutter`.
3. Deliver the report from Step 7 and the open gaps.
